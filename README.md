# BallChamps – Sports Companion Mobile App

**BallChamps** is a high-performance, cross-platform mobile application built in **.NET (C#)**, tailored for sports enthusiasts. Designed for both Android and iOS, it delivers a smooth, interactive experience featuring live scores, player statistics, match schedules, and real-time discussions.

This was one of my **first large-scale freelance projects on Fiverr**, where I took full ownership of the development process—from back-end logic to front-end UI/UX design.

## Key Highlights:
- **Complete app architecture and development** in C# and XAML
- **Custom-designed UI/UX** for intuitive navigation and user engagement
- **Seamless API integration** for real-time data updates and server interaction
- Optimized performance across devices and OS versions
- Designed to handle a diverse, global user base

BallChamps represents a significant milestone in my mobile development career. It showcases my ability to transform complex ideas into a fully functional and polished product while working independently with real clients.
